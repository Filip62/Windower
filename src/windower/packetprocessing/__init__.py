"""
Packetprocessing package provides functions for processing raw packets, extracting their features, and
logging them into structures defined by time windows.  These can be used offline to generate datasets
and train the model, but online use is possible as well, although modules are not explicitly designed
with respect to performance, so packet throughput may be severely limited.  If modules from this
package would be implemented online, feature extraction is recommended to be performed in FPGA, and
logging/windowing in a lower level compiled language such as C/C++ or distributed using technologies
such as Apache Flink.
